## Preface

Project Modern was born as a community response to increasing power creep, bad format health, and an apparent disconnect between WotC and the Modern community in regards to the future of the Modern format.

Between then and now, much has happened in both formats and we would like to acknowledge WotC for taking steps in the right direction: The negative impact companions had across formats has been mitigated and [Arcum's Astrolabe](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/220/arcums-astrolabe) has been identified as one of the root causes for Modern’s demise in 2020. As a result, Modern has opened up again and seems more diverse and healthy than it has been in quite some time.

## Where does this leave Project Modern?

The path we chose to take with Project Modern does not end here. We will continue to work towards a Modern format that is inherently healthy and towards a Modern format that we can believe in by providing full data transparency, taking decisions disjunct from corporate sales, and listening to the community.

Our contribution will continue to be a template of what Modern could become. To this end, we have made the following changes to Project Modern.

## Set Legality

As of August 3rd, 2020 Core Set 2021 (M21), Ikoria (IKO), and Theros Beyond Death (TBH) are legal for [organized play](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ch4XkQkS-w3hs4UmCgQrJGHXi_hEfW3tqrR1yQQR0UA/edit).

Project Modern is thus caught up to the Modern card pool and will move forward on a set by set basis.

We will continue to provide monthly B&R and metagame updates.

## Metagame Data

In July, Project Modern counted approximately 500 matches being played in officially sanctioned events. Here is what the metagame looked like:

![Metagame Snapshot](august-third-metagame.png)

On the surface level, one can easily recognize a healthy spread of archetypes across the format, with no deck accounting for more than 7% of the meta. At the same time, the diversity between these individual archetypes is pretty high with Death’s Shadow, Green Tron, Storm, Jund, Ascendency, Slivers, Lantern Control, Affinity, Titanshift and UW Control representing the top 10 archetypes - together making up a Metagame share of 51,55%.

Three out of ten decks utilize the previously unbanned [Preordain](https://scryfall.com/card/c15/101/preordain) (Storm, Ascendency, UW Control). While Storm was the obvious beneficiary of said legalization, it is also the archetype with one of the worst overall win rates (45%) in the format. Emry Ascendancy Combo does not only have access to [Preordain](https://scryfall.com/card/c15/101/preordain) but also utilizes [Mox Opal](https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/275/mox-opal) as a means to generate fast mana and therefore had to be on everyone’s radar. The deck appeared to be near unbeatable during the first week, but as the meta adapted to it, the win rate plummeted to 51,8%. UW Control represents the least played archetype of the three but accounts for the highest overall win rate (65%). Note that UW Control came in two different versions: UW Miracles with [Opt](https://scryfall.com/card/m21/59/opt) and UW Control with [Preordain](https://scryfall.com/card/c15/101/preordain) which both performed similarly well. Although it is too early to draw definite conclusions, [Preordain](https://scryfall.com/card/c15/101/preordain) currently does not appear to harm the format and instead provides tools to previously non-existent archetypes.

Furthermore, amongst the top 10 most played archetypes, there are only two with a win rate of >55% in Green Tron and UW Control respectively. Jund also performed decently (52%) but otherwise, the most played decks were pretty weak in comparison to the fringer strategies (<50%).

Looking at the performance on the right-hand side paints a different picture altogether: despite accounting for relatively small metagame shares, the top spots are dominated by control and combo decks alike, followed by big mana and aggro. The sample size is statistically insignificant for most archetypes, but that space could still be worth exploring going forward.

Overall, we are happy with the direction the format took in July. The changes we made last month seem to have paid off and the meta does look healthy and fun. Now, with the introduction of IKO, THB, and Core 21 the exposure to new cards & synergies is high and we are likely going to see a major meta shift. Additionally, [Splinter Twin](https://scryfall.com/card/mm2/129/splinter-twin) is going to enter the format temporarily which will also yield a response in terms of what people are playing. In comparison to last month, which has built a solid foundation, August is going to bring an exciting and experimental phase with it.

As always, we will analyze the data and base our decisions on it going forward.

## Bannings

As of August 3rd, 2020 the following cards are banned from organized play:

 - [Underworld Breach](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/161/underworld-breach)


[Underworld Breach](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/161/underworld-breach) has drawn immediate comparisons to Yawgmoth’s Will after its printing, as both feature a design that has not been utilized since Urza’s Saga. The underlying problem is the comparatively low cost to e.g. Past in Flames while also providing the ability to return permanents. Both of these characteristics become stronger as the availability of low CMC permanents grows. Aside from Pioneer, where Underworld breach has already been identified as a problematic card, Project Modern does currently feature [Mox Opal](https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/275/mox-opal) - a card that fits all the requirements to enable [Underworld Breach](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/161/underworld-breach) decks to go infinite as early as turn 2 somewhat consistently. Additionally, the perceived play patterns are unfun and difficult to interact with outside of graveyard hate. At this point, we would also like to mention that we are not going to protect [Mox Opal](https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/275/mox-opal) if it were to pose issues, but that Underworld breach is the problematic card in this case.

## Unbannings

As of August 3rd, 2020 the following cards are temporarily unbanned from organized play:

 - [Splinter Twin](https://scryfall.com/card/mm2/129/splinter-twin)

[Splinter Twin](https://scryfall.com/card/mm2/129/splinter-twin) has been subject to some of the most heated discussions since its ban from Modern in 2016. One side argues for it to have been the format’s police that checked the unfair and unfun, others argue for it to have been one of the most miserable decks to play against itself. What we can agree on is that nobody wants to see [Splinter Twin](https://scryfall.com/card/mm2/129/splinter-twin) representing 20% of the metagame and that everyone has their personal archetypes to hate. Aside from the “love it or hate it” arguments, Modern has evolved into a more powerful environment during the past 4 years. There are new threats, different play patterns but also new answers to Splinter Twin that have not existed before. Our preliminary, controlled testing efforts have yielded positive results in regards to [Splinter Twin](https://scryfall.com/card/mm2/129/splinter-twin) being on par with the current power level of Modern - but others might be able to develop even stronger shells for [Splinter Twin](https://scryfall.com/card/mm2/129/splinter-twin). We would now like to expand our testing efforts to the wider community to generate reliable data on [Splinter Twin](https://scryfall.com/card/mm2/129/splinter-twin) in a post-2016 Modern World. As always, we will be fully transparent about the outcome and anyone is welcome in helping us answer this discussion at hand - at least from a Project Modern perspective.

## Watchlist Bans

The Council has decided to inform you of certain cards and strategies that are being monitored for the future health of Project Modern. This means that, without other unforeseen issues arising, our data analysis is going to target these cards specifically. They represent long term concerns to overall format diversity and play patterns, but may be considered healthy given more data in the future. It also means that we may act on any of these cards at any point in time given enough reason to do so.

 - [Bridge From Below](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/87/bridge-from-below) in combination with a sac outlet such as [Altar Of Dementia](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/218/altar-of-dementia) tends to lead to very fast kills from both the graveyard as well as the battlefield in ways that are difficult to interact with for most decks, however, they also tend to be glass cannons. We will continue to monitor decks that utilize Bridge closely. In the event of archetypes involving one or both of these cards receiving a significant share in the metagame while also reaching top results in tournament play, we are going to take a closer look at the issue at hand to isolate which card brings the most unfair or unfun parts of these decks to fruition. During July, Bridge received very little play and the little it was played did not feel oppressive. As it appears currently Bridge does not seem problematic.

 - [Teferi, Time Raveler](https://scryfall.com/card/war/221/teferi-time-raveler) has proven to facilitate play patterns that are received as unfun by a significant margin of the player base while also shutting down some archetypes and mechanics in their entirety. Outside of board states involving multiple threats, Teferi is very difficult to interact with due to the forced play at sorcery speed as well as the bounce ability - this is especially true for decks utilizing [Force of Negation](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/52/force-of-negation) as a means of protection. While we do not believe that Teferi is critical in terms of power level alone, we are aware of the overall sentiment towards Teferi and may take action in case of widespread utilization leading to stale and repetitive gameplay. In the upcoming meta, we expect to see an uptick in play rate in conjunction with the temporary Twin testing. If the card proves to be problematic we will evaluate the state of its legality in the format but from our current meta data, the card has seen little to no play.

 - [Urza, Lord High Artificer](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/75/urza-lord-high-artificer) resides at the top of Modern’s Metagame ever since its printing in MH1. In the light of one of the most iconic characters of Magic history, multiple archetypes were recreated and homogenized around it. While Urza does represent a high power level, has utility in multiples despite being legendary due to its ETB effect and shows to be very resilient to common hate, the removal of [Arcum’s Astrolabe](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/220/arcums-astrolabe) from the format has weakened the archetype in a variety of ways. As of July first, there has only been one registered decklist featuring [Urza, Lord High Artificer](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/75/urza-lord-high-artificer) accounting for a 0% win percentage in 5 competitive matches. This is not statistically significant and might be tied to the pilot, but it is the only data to work with. With the addition of Throne of Eldraine specifically, the Council expects the archetype to receive a power boost in [Emry, Lurcher of the Loch](https://scryfall.com/card/eld/43/emry-lurker-of-the-loch), [Gilded Goose](https://scryfall.com/card/eld/160/gilded-goose) as well as [Mystic Sanctuary](https://scryfall.com/card/eld/247/mystic-sanctuary) which is why we will keep monitoring the metagame in regards to [Urza, Lord High Artificer](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/75/urza-lord-high-artificer).

 - [Dryad of the Ilysian Grove](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/169/dryad-of-the-ilysian-grove) has been shown in Modern to slot into multiple big mana decks, such as Amulet Titan and [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](https://scryfall.com/card/zen/228/valakut-the-molten-pinnacle) based decks. Dryad causes these decks to operate on multiple axes simultaneously, either creating additional equally powerful wincons as was available previously or enabling a level of consistency that allows the inclusion of packages that create wholly separate axes of play. These include ramping to a win condition, defense against aggressive strategies due to high toughness, an offense against control strategies due to low but relevant power, effective stacking as Dryad is not legendary, protection from [Blood Moon](https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/118/blood-moon) effects which are generally a weakness of big mana strategies, allowing decks with no mountains (e.g. Amulet Titan) to play a single copy of Valakut as a win condition, and opening space for blue-based control strategies to be run alongside a combo finish with very little cost. Embodying a combination of the abilities from [Azusa, Lost but Seeking](https://scryfall.com/card/m21/173/azusa-lost-but-seeking) and [Prismatic Omen](https://scryfall.com/card/shm/126/prismatic-omen), with the stats of [Courser of Krufix](https://scryfall.com/card/bng/119/es/cazadora-de-krufix  ), the cost of running a full playset is drastically lower than the former two cards. Dryad will be closely watched for these reasons.

 - [Mox Opal](https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/275/mox-opal) is given a full playset in almost every artifact-based deck, and it has been a mainstay of the format since its beginning. Opal has received regular criticism during this time in numerous archetypes, multiples of which have received other bans. Most recently, KCI Combo. We are adding [Mox Opal](https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/275/mox-opal) to the watchlist as a result of interactions within existing decks such as [Urza, Lord High Artificer](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/75/urza-lord-high-artificer) strategies and Emry Ascendancy, our awareness of [Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy](https://scryfall.com/card/iko/192/kinnan-bonder-prodigy)’s addition to the format with M21’s legality, and awareness around WOTC no longer considering [Mox Opal](https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/275/mox-opal) interactions in Modern (such as Underworld Breach and Ozolith). As part of the format mission to minimize the number of future bannings, [Mox Opal](https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/275/mox-opal) will be monitored going forward.
